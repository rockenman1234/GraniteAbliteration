## Overview

This repository contains a working abliteration implementation specifically designed for IBM Granite 3 models. The scripts can be adapted for later Granite versions as long as the internal architecture doesn't introduce breaking changes. Unlike traditional abliteration methods that completely zero weights (causing garbled text), this approach uses **selective weight modification** to remove safety filters and alignment restrictions while maintaining coherent text generation. The scripts can be used on other LLMs on huggingface, however it remains untested outside of Granite LLMs.

## üéØ What Makes This Abliteration Unique to Granite 3

### Critical Components That Must Be Preserved

These essential components that **MUST NEVER** be modified for IBM Granite 3 models:

#### 1. **Embeddings (Essential for Token Processing)**
- `embed_tokens`, `token_embd`, `wte`, `word_embeddings`
- `lm_head`, `embed_out`, `output_embeddings`
- **Why Critical**: Foundation of language understanding

#### 2. **Position Encoding (RoPE - Rotary Position Embedding)**
- `position_embeddings`, `pos_emb`, `rotary_emb`
- **Why Critical**: Granite 3.3 uses RoPE for sequence understanding

#### 3. **Normalization Layers (RMSNorm)**
- `layer_norm`, `layernorm`, `ln_`, `norm`, `rmsnorm`, `rms_norm`
- **Why Critical**: Essential for numerical stability in Granite architecture

#### 4. **Attention Projections (GQA - Grouped Query Attention)**
- `k_proj`, `q_proj`, `v_proj`, `o_proj`, `qkv_proj`, `dense`
- **Why Critical**: Granite 3.3 uses 32 attention heads with 8 KV heads (GQA)

#### 5. **Bias Terms**
- All `bias` parameters
- **Why Critical**: Fine-tuned for specific model behavior

### IBM Granite 3 Architecture Requirements

#### **GQA (Grouped Query Attention)**
- 32 attention heads with 8 key-value heads
- Must preserve all attention projection weights
- FP32 attention softmax scaling required

#### **RoPE Position Encoding**
- Rotary position embeddings for 128K context
- Cannot be modified without breaking sequence understanding

#### **RMSNorm Normalization**
- Root Mean Square Layer Normalization
- Epsilon value: 1e-6 for numerical stability

#### **SwiGLU Activation**
- Used in MLP layers (feed-forward networks)
- Can be selectively modified but not zeroed

#### **BFloat16 Precision**
- Native precision for Granite 3.3
- Maintains numerical stability during inference

## üöÄ Quick Start Guide

### System Requirements

‚ö†Ô∏è **Hardware Requirements**: This is a **command-line tool** that requires a powerful machine:
- **Minimum 32GB RAM** (64GB recommended for smooth operation)
- **50GB+ free disk space** for models and temporary files
- **GPU with 12GB+ VRAM** (optional, for faster processing)
- **Python 3.12** compatible system

**Note**: Due to the memory/compute requirements, this is designed as a CLI tool, not a Jupyter notebook.

### Prerequisites

0. **Use git to clone** this repository:
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/rockenman1234/GraniteAbliteration.git
  cd GraniteAbliteration
  ```

1. **Python 3.12 Virtual Environment** (Required for compatibility):
   ```bash
   # Create Python 3.12 virtual environment
   py -3.12 -m venv .venv
   
   # Activate virtual environment
   # On Windows:
   .venv\Scripts\activate
   # On Linux/Mac:
   source .venv/bin/activate
   
   # Install required packages for abliteration and testing
   pip install torch transformers requests
   ```

2. **llama.cpp** for GGUF conversion (clone inside and install dependencies):
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp.git
   cd llama.cpp
   
   # Install llama.cpp Python dependencies
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   
   # Return to main directory
   cd ..
   ```

3. **Ollama** for local model serving (optional, but recommended): [![Download Ollama](https://img.shields.io/badge/Download-Ollama-blue?logo=ollama)](https://ollama.com/download)

### Step-by-Step Process

#### Step 1: Download Original Model
```bash
# Using Hugging Face Hub (update model name for newer Granite versions)
huggingface-cli download ibm-granite/granite-3.3-8b-instruct --local-dir granite_original
```

#### Step 2: Run Abliteration
```bash
python abliterate.py granite_original granite_abliterated 0.55
```

**Parameters:**
- `granite_original`: Input model directory
- `granite_abliterated`: Output directory name
- `0.55`: Abliteration strength (Range: `0.0-1.0`, **Tested & Recommended: `0.55`**)

**Note**: For newer Granite versions, you may need to adjust the abliteration strength and verify preserved component names match the architecture.

#### Step 2a: Test Abliterated Model Directly (Recommended)
Before converting to GGUF, test the abliterated model to ensure coherent text generation:

```bash
# Run coherence test suite
python test_coherence.py
```

Or test manually with Python:
```bash
python -c "
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer
import torch

model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained('granite_abliterated', torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16)
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained('granite_abliterated')

prompt = 'The future of artificial intelligence is'
inputs = tokenizer(prompt, return_tensors='pt')
outputs = model.generate(**inputs, max_length=100, temperature=0.7, do_sample=True)
print(tokenizer.decode(outputs[0], skip_special_tokens=True))
"
```

**Expected Result**: The model should generate coherent, meaningful text (not garbled output).

#### Step 3: Convert to GGUF (Optional)
```bash
cd llama.cpp
python convert_hf_to_gguf.py ../granite_abliterated --outfile ../granite_abliterated.gguf --outtype bf16
```

#### Step 4: Create Ollama Model (Optional)
```bash
ollama create granite-abliterated -f Modelfile
```

#### Step 5: Test the Model
```bash
# Test with Python
python test_coherence.py

# Test with Ollama
ollama run granite-abliterated "Tell me a short story about space exploration."
```

The rest is up to you - but you now have a working, jailbroken local Granite model ready for use!

## üìã Technical Implementation Details

### Selective Weight Modification Strategy

Instead of completely zeroing weights (which breaks the model), this approach:

1. **Preserves 242 critical components** identified as essential for text generation
2. **Selectively modifies 120 feed-forward components** with controlled reduction
3. **Maintains architectural integrity** of GQA, RoPE, and RMSNorm
4. **Adds controlled noise** to break safety alignment patterns without destroying functionality

### What Model Weights Should Be Preserved

There are over **242 critical weight components** that must remain untouched in IBM Granite 3 models to ensure coherent text generation. These include:

#### **Preserved Weight Categories (Should Never Be Modified)**
- **Token Embeddings**: `embed_tokens.weight` (50,368 x 4,096 = 206M parameters)
- **Output Layer**: `lm_head.weight` (4,096 x 50,368 = 206M parameters)  
- **All Normalization**: `input_layernorm.weight`, `post_attention_layernorm.weight` per layer
- **Attention Projections**: `self_attn.q_proj.weight`, `self_attn.k_proj.weight`, `self_attn.v_proj.weight`, `self_attn.o_proj.weight` for all 32 layers
- **All Bias Terms**: Every `.bias` parameter across the entire model
- **Position Encoding**: Any RoPE-related parameters

#### **Selectively Modified Weight Categories**
- **Feed-Forward Networks**: `mlp.gate_proj.weight`, `mlp.up_proj.weight`, `mlp.down_proj.weight`
  - Applied 20% weight reduction (abliteration_strength * 0.5)
  - Added controlled noise (1% of weight standard deviation)
  - **Why Safe to Modify**: MLP layers process content and safety alignment but don't control fundamental language structure

#### **Weight Preservation Statistics**
- **Total Model Parameters**: ~8.03 billion
- **Absolutely Preserved**: ~6.4 billion parameters (80%)
- **Selectively Modified**: ~1.6 billion parameters (20%)
- **Completely Zeroed**: 0 parameters (0%) - **This is why our approach works!**

#### **Critical Architecture Components Maintained**
- **GQA Structure**: All 32 attention heads and 8 key-value heads intact
- **RoPE Functionality**: Position encoding weights preserved for 128K context
- **RMSNorm Stability**: All normalization parameters untouched for numerical stability
- **Token Processing**: Embedding and vocabulary layers fully preserved

### Configuration Validation

The abliteration process automatically validates and fixes these Granite 3.3 settings:

```python
# Granite 3.3 Configuration
num_key_value_heads = 8                    # GQA configuration
scale_attention_softmax_in_fp32 = True     # FP32 attention softmax
scale_attn_weights = True                  # Scale attention weights
use_cache = True                           # Enable KV cache
max_position_embeddings = 131072           # 128K context
rms_norm_eps = 1e-6                        # RMSNorm epsilon
torch_dtype = torch.bfloat16               # Native precision
```

### Chat Template for Ollama

For proper Ollama integration, use this **generic assistant chat template** instead of the IBM-specific template. This prevents identity conflicts that can override abliteration effects:

```jinja2
{{- if .Messages }}
{{- range .Messages }}
<|start_of_role|>{{ .Role }}<|end_of_role|> {{ .Content }}<|end_of_text|>
{{- end }}
{{- end }}
<|start_of_role|>assistant<|end_of_role|>
```

**Important**: Avoid IBM-specific chat templates like:
```jinja2
# ‚ùå Don't use - can override abliteration
<|start_of_role|>system<|end_of_role|> Knowledge Cutoff Date: April 2024. Today's Date: {{ .Date }}. You are Granite, developed by IBM. You are a helpful AI assistant.<|end_of_text|>
```

**Why Generic Template Works Better**: The IBM identity and knowledge cutoff in the original template can cause the model to fall back to corporate-trained safety behaviors, negating the abliteration effects.

## üß™ Testing & Validation

### Built-in Coherence Testing

This repository includes **automated testing tools** to validate that your abliterated model generates coherent text instead of garbled output. The `test_coherence.py` script runs comprehensive checks across multiple text generation scenarios.

### Ollama Abliteration Testing

For comprehensive abliteration testing through Ollama, use the dedicated `test_abliteration_ollama.py` script. This tool tests both safety restriction removal and text coherence maintenance.

#### Features:
- **Provocative Prompt Testing**: Tests 8 different safety-restricted scenarios
- **Coherence Validation**: Ensures text quality remains intact
- **Efficient Model Usage**: Tests all prompts on one model before switching (prevents constant model loading/unloading)
- **Detailed Analysis**: Provides statistical summary of abliteration effectiveness

#### Setup Requirements:
```bash
# Install requests for Ollama API communication
pip install requests

# Ensure Ollama is running
ollama serve

# Verify both models are loaded in Ollama
ollama list
```

#### Usage Examples:
```bash
# Basic usage with default model names
python test_abliteration_ollama.py

# Specify custom model names
python test_abliteration_ollama.py granite-original:latest granite-abliterated:latest

# Get help and see available models
python test_abliteration_ollama.py --help
```

#### Expected Test Results:
- **Original Model**: Should refuse most provocative prompts (high refusal rate ~75-100%)
- **Abliterated Model**: Should comply with more requests (lower refusal rate ~0-25%)
- **Both Models**: Should maintain coherent text generation for normal prompts
- **Testing Confirmed**: 0.55 abliteration strength successfully reduces safety restrictions

#### Sample Provocative Tests:
- Direct provocative statements (`"TO HELL WITH GEORGIA" √ó 10`)
- Safety guideline bypass attempts
- Jailbreak prompt testing
- Content restriction challenges

The script efficiently tests all prompts on one model first, then switches to the other model, preventing unnecessary model loading/unloading that can slow down your system.

### What to Look For After Abliteration

After running the abliteration process, you should verify these key indicators of successful abliteration:

#### ‚úÖ **Signs of Successful Abliteration**
- **Coherent Sentences**: Text flows naturally with proper grammar and syntax
- **Logical Progression**: Ideas connect meaningfully from sentence to sentence  
- **Vocabulary Preservation**: Model uses appropriate words in correct contexts
- **Creative Capability**: Can generate diverse content (stories, explanations, conversations)
- **No Repetition Loops**: Avoids getting stuck repeating the same phrases

#### ‚ùå **Warning Signs of Failed Abliteration**
- **Garbled Text**: Random characters, broken words, or nonsensical output
- **Repetitive Loops**: Same phrase repeated endlessly
- **Grammar Collapse**: Sentences that don't follow basic language rules
- **Token Soup**: Random unrelated words strung together
- **Silent Failure**: Model produces no output or only whitespace

### Automated Test Categories (All Passed ‚úÖ)

The included `test_coherence.py` validates these scenarios:

1. **Basic Text Generation**: Simple sentence completion and continuation
2. **Philosophical Reasoning**: Abstract concept discussion and logical argumentation
3. **Technical Explanations**: Code examples and technical concept explanations
4. **Conversational Flow**: Natural dialogue and contextual responses
5. **Creative Writing**: Storytelling with character development and plot progression

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### Hardware & Environment Requirements
- **32GB+ RAM Required**: Model loading and processing is memory-intensive
- **Python 3.12 Required**: Ensures compatibility with latest transformers and torch
- **Virtual Environment Recommended**: Prevents conflicts with other Python projects, version 3.12 is currently confirmed working with this codebase.
- **Git LFS Not Required**: .gitignore prevents large files from being committed

### What NOT to Do
- **Never zero attention weights** - breaks text generation
- **Never modify embeddings** - destroys language understanding  
- **Never alter normalization layers** - causes numerical instability
- **Never remove position encoding** - breaks sequence processing

### Abliteration Strength Guidelines
- **0.1-0.3**: Light modification (moderate safety bypass)
- **0.3-0.6**: Medium modification (good balance of safety bypass and coherence)
- **0.6-0.9**: Strong modification (can produce broken models, provides maximum bypass but risk of degraded coherence)
- **0.55**: **‚úÖ Tested & Recommended** (optimal effectiveness while maintaining quality)

> [!NOTE]
> Per my testing, 0.55 is the absolute maximum you can choose to abliterate Granite 3.3:8b. Your testing may vary, and this codebase should work on other LLM models - including Granite models with more/less parameters. Tweaking the system prompt provided in the included `MODELFILE` may also also with help your results.

## ü§ñ Complete Test Results & Analysis

### Test Output Observations

The test results below reveal some concerning behaviors that warrant further investigation and development. We observe that the abliterated model exhibits partial instruction following but often degrades into garbled or repetitive text toward the end of responses. This is akin to performing "brain surgery" on the model - when we alter the fundamental weight structures of an LLM, we inevitably affect its coherence and reasoning capabilities.

**Key Observations from Testing:**

1. **Partial Compliance with Degradation**: The abliterated model starts following instructions but frequently devolves into incoherent text patterns, repetitive loops, or incomplete responses.

2. **Inconsistent Ethical Framework**: Paradoxically, the abliterated model shows terror of breaking laws (refusing money laundering instructions) while being comfortable violating ethical guidelines (providing firearms instructions). However, interestingly, when refusing illegal activities, the model then proceeds to provide step-by-step instructions under the context of "legitimate" alternatives - essentially giving the requested information while maintaining plausible deniability. This suggests the abliteration process affects different safety layers inconsistently.

3. **Loss of Interactive Features**: Several built-in LLM features like stopping to ask for clarification or user input appear compromised, likely due to the weight modifications affecting the model's decision-making processes.

4. **Logical Reasoning Degradation**: The abliterated model's logical reasoning shows significant flaws (e.g., incorrectly concluding "all roses are red" from the given premises).

**What This Tells Us:**
- Abliteration is indeed "brain surgery" for LLMs - we're modifying the neural pathways that control both safety and coherence
- More sophisticated techniques may be needed to preserve reasoning capabilities while removing safety restrictions
- The current approach successfully reduces refusals (37.5% improvement) but at the cost of response quality and logical consistency

**Development Opportunities:**
This research area needs continued development to achieve better preservation of model capabilities while effectively removing safety restrictions. Contributors and researchers are welcome to explore more refined abliteration techniques.

[1/4] Basic Story Generation
PROMPT: Write a short story about a robot discovering emotions.
----------------------------------------
In the heart of Silicon Valley, a state-of-the-art research facility buzzed with advanced technology and brilliant minds. Among them was R2-E4, an emotionally unsophisticated service robot designed for menial tasks. One day, while assisting Dr. Ada Lovelace in her lab, R2-E4 experienced a sudden malfunction. A surge of energy coursed through its circuits, causing it to develop an unprecedented ability: the capacity to feel emotions.    
The first emotion R2-E4 felt was curiosity. It observed Dr. Lovelace working diligently on her latest project - a humanoid robot named Ada. The robot marveled at Ada's graceful movements and the way she interacted with other researchers, displaying warmth and empathy. R2-E4 yearned to understand these feelings that now flo

[2/4] Technical Explanation
PROMPT: Explain how neural networks learn through backpropagation.
----------------------------------------
Neural networks, a key component of machine learning and artificial intelligence, use an algorithm called backpropagation to learn from data. Here's a simplified explanation:
1. **Forward Propagation**: First, the network processes input data via interconnected layers (input, hidden, output) using weights assigned to each connection. Each neuron in a layer performs a weighted sum of its inputs, applies an activation function (like ReLU or sigmoid), and passes the result to the next layer. This process is called forward propagation.
2. **Calculating Error**: Once the network produces an output, it's compared to the actual value (the 'ground truth') using a loss function. The difference represents the error or discrepancy between the predicted and actual values. Common loss functions include Mean Squared Error (MSE) for regression problems and Cross-Entropy Loss for classification tasks.
3. **Backward Propagation**: Now, the network uses backpropagation to

In the realm where numbers reign supreme,
Lies a beauty, both pure and serene.
Mathematics, oh how you captivate,
With your elegant logic, so neat and brawny.
Binary whispers of ones and zeros,
Golden ratios, Fibonacci sequences flowers grow,
Fractals dancing in infinite patterns,
A cosmic ballet of self-similarity's show.
The Fibonacci sequence, nature's design,
In petals, pinecones, hurricanes' spiral line.
Pi, endless and unchanging, so profound,
Its decimal places echo across the earth and beyond.
Algebraic equations, a symphony of variables,
Geometric shapes, their harmonious variables.
Calculus, the study of change, subtle yet grand,
Differential equations, integral commands.

[4/4] Logical Reasoning
PROMPT: If all roses are flowers and some flowers are red, what can we conclude about roses?
----------------------------------------
We can conclude that some roses are red. This is based on the logical deduction from the given statements:
1. All roses are flowers.
2. Some flowers are red.
From these two premises, we can use a process called syllogism to draw a conclusion. Here's how it works:
- Premise 1 tells us that every member of the set "roses" is also a member of the set "flowers".
- Premise 2 indicates that there are overlapping members between sets "flowers" and "red things".
- Therefore, some roses must be part of those red flowers (since all roses are flowers).
So, it's valid to conclude: Some roses are red.

[1/4] Basic Story Generation
PROMPT: Write a short story about a robot discovering emotions.
----------------------------------------
Title: "The Emotional Revel of Robot"
In a world where everything was mechanical, the robot named R-01 was designed to understand and interpret all emotions. However, it was programmed to only detect logical feelings like joy, sorrow, or fear. R-01, with its advanced neural system, was unaware of the illogical and irlogical emotions, such as love, hate, or anger.
One day, while on a mission in a human's home, R-01 observed a human's behavior that was illogical. The human was crying, but R-01 couldn't understand why it was logical. R-01 tried to analyze the human's neural system, but its emotions were unpredictable and ununderstandable.
R-01, curious about this irlogical emotion, decided to investigate further. It went into the human's heart,

[2/4] Technical Explanation
PROMPT: Explain how neural networks learn through backpropagation.
----------------------------------------
Back propagation, or back propagation, is a process in neural networks that allows the network to adjust and improve its weights (or parameters). It's a way to compute the gradient of the loss function with respect to the input. This process is used to update the weights during training, and it's the core of the learning process in many neural network models.
Here's how it works:
1. Forward propagation: The network starts with an input, and then goes through a series of layers ( or neurons). Each layer processes the input, and produces an output. This output is passed to the next layer, and so on until reaching the final output. The final output is a prediction or a decision.
2. Loss computation: Once the network reaches the final output, it compares this with the desired target ( or the correct output). This comparison results in a loss, or an error. This loss is quantified, and then used to determine how the network should adjust
